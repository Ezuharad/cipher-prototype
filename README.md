# Cellular Automata for Encryption
This is the (WIP) code and RFC for a novel encryption algorithm based on cellular automata. More will be added in the coming days.

Work has been done in using CAs for encryption schemes; however, I have consciously avoided this work, as I ultimately seek to implement something unique.

**It should be once again emphasized that this is both in progress and merely a research exercise; I am not a crypanalyst or mathematician by trade, and using this code for any serious endeavor would likely yield disasterous consequences.**
