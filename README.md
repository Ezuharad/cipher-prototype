# Cellular Automata for Encryption
This is the (WIP) code and RFC for a novel encryption algorithm based on cellular automata. More will be added in the coming days.
It should be once again emphasized that this is work in progress, and that this project should be regarded as nothing more than a research exercise; I am not a crypanalyst or mathematician by trade, and using this code for any serious endeavor would likely yield disasterous consequences.
Work has been done in using CAs for encryption schemes; however, I have consciously avoided this work, as I ultimately seek to implement something unique.
