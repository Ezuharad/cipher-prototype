# Talos: Cellular Automata for Encryption
This is the code and RFC for a novel encryption algorithm based on cellular automata.

**It should be emphasized that this is merely a research exercise; I am not a crypanalyst or mathematician by trade, and using this code for any serious endeavor would likely yield disasterous consequences.**

Work has been done in using CAs for encryption schemes; however, I have consciously avoided this work, as I ultimately seek to implement something unique.
